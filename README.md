# Nanotrasen Simulator

_You are an AI trained to manage Nanotrasen when there is no-one left to manage it. This is a simulation to make sure you can do it properly._

A [universal paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/)-like game set in the Space Station 13 universe with you playing as an AI in a simulation.

## What is this?

Idle clicker game thing set in the Space Station 13 universe, check SS13 (and SS14) out. They're fun, and they've brought me a good 2000 hours of joy, the only game I have 2000 hours on.

## Contributors

NTS is full of undocumented and really big spaghetti code. While it would be nice if you could take your time to document things, it's perfectly fine if you just want to work on cool content to make this game worse.

You require a webserver to run NT Simulator as fetch doesn't work on raw HTML. You can set up a live server using python or an extension through your editor/IDE.
